All that I have been grinding on in the year 2022-23! (Mainly Python)
Special Mention:

\nThe Permutations program: I found permuatations a bit hard, so I tried to make a code which could help me out a bit!


The Tic-Tac-Toe Game: Started learning some matrices, so I created a game on 24-25th November. The only problem is that you have to deliberately play bad in order to lose... am working on that too
