All that I have been grinding on in the year 2022-23! 
(Mainly Python)
Special Mention:
The Permutations program: I found permuatations a bit hard, so I tried to make a code which could help me out a bit!

Work-in-Progresses:
The Tic-Tac-Toe Game: Started learning some matrices, working on this game since 24th November 2022!
